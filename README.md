# My Portfolio Website

## Project Overview

Here's my portfolio website. The purpose of this site is to be a place where anyone can learn about me and the work I do. I'll include links to my other sites including LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub, as well as a way to contact me by email or text message.

I created this site to showcase my work and also to show what can be done with just HTML and CSS, plus just a few lines of JavaScript. No frameworks or special libraries needed. Let me know if you need help with a portfolio website or anything else you see on this site.

This site is built with a single main index.html file plus a css file for styling and a separate html file for each project in the portfolio. There is a small JavaScript file just to add a little animation to the menu. This was a fun project and it certainly made me appreciate the power of tools like React and BootStrap.

As it is, this site would be a challenge to maintain as the header and footer elements are repeated in each html file. Now that the basics are in place, I'll make some resuseable html components to make this site much easier to maintain.

I'll be adding more projects to the list soon.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! to Kevin Powell at Scrimba and the instructors at Springboard and the Rithm School for helping me learn the basics of CSS.
